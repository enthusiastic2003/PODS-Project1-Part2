/**
 * This class represents the Customer entity in the system.
 * It is annotated with @Entity, indicating that it is a JPA entity mapped to a database table.
 * The class contains the following fields:
 * - id (Integer): The unique identifier for each customer, automatically generated with the 
 *   @GeneratedValue annotation using the IDENTITY strategy (auto-increment).
 * - name (String): The name of the customer.
 * - email (String): The email address of the customer.
 * - discount_availed (Boolean): A flag indicating whether the customer has availed a discount (default is false).
 *
 * The @Data annotation from Lombok is used to generate boilerplate code like getters, setters, 
 * equals, hashcode, and toString methods automatically. The @Getter and @Setter annotations 
 * are also included for explicit getter and setter method generation, though @Data already covers them.
